# HW 3 : Inference and Relations
# [CS 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2021](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/1262)

-------

# Purpose and Background
This homework provides practice in
- applying rules of inference
- the use of quantifiers
- writing precise and correct proofs
- proof techniques
- properties of relations
- equivalence relations and their representations
- the matrix representation of equivalence relations
- partial orders
- properties of partial orders
- the Hasse diagram representation of partial orders
- proving the validity of arguments
- proving mathematical statements
- proving the properties of relations

Solutions to homework questions will be graded not so much on their correctness as on the correct and precise specification of all the steps involved. The rigor of the supporting arguments carry more weight than the correctness of the answer.

# Time Requirement
Based on the feedback from pervious students who attempted this assignment, the time requirement for this assignment in number of hours is: _data unavailable_.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

## HW 3.1 Problem Set
Write your solutions in the _same_ LaTeX file as provided and push the completed file to your repository. The files in your repository at the time of the deadline will be taken as your submission. There is no late submission.

This is a team submission and the earned score is the team's _Submission Score_.

Deadline: 2359h on Monday, 5 April.

## HW 3.2 Homework Feedback Form

You have to provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW 3.2_ under the _Assignments_ module on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an individual submission. Submitting it contibutes to your individual _Team Factor_ which is a fraction between 0 and 1.

Deadline: 2359h on Monday, 5 April.

# Grading

Your individual score is computed as the product of:
- your team's _Submission Score_
- your individual _Team Factor_

Your Team Factor is 1 by default and is penalized in the following cases:
- lack of timely submission of HW 2.2
- lack of contribution to the team as indicated by your buddy
- lack of evidence of contribution to the team as indicated on GitHub

# Outside Resources

Explicitly mention any outside sources that you use. Not mentioning them will be seen as a case of passing outside work as your own which is an instance of academic dishonesty.

# Discussion

Please use the following avenues to discuss the homework.
- discuss with your buddy
- post in the discussion thread on the homework which is available under the _Assignments_ module on the course page
- talk to course staff in their desginated hours
